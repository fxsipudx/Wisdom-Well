## **Technical Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **SwiftUI**: Used to design the app's user interface, ensuring responsiveness and modern design principles.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `@State` to manage dynamic content like queries, responses, and error messages.

### **Backend**
- **Firebase Functions**: Callable Functions handle requests securely and interact with OpenAI API for response generation.
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**: Processes the input queries and generates insightful biblical explanations.
- **Firebase Emulator**: Used for local development and testing of functions before deployment.

### **Cloud Infrastructure**
- **Firebase Hosting**: Easily extendable for hosting or app distribution.
- **Firestore** (Optional): Can be added for storing user data or historical queries.

### **Installation Steps**

#### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Wisdom-Well.git
cd Wisdom-Well
```

#### **2. Firebase Setup**
1. Navigate to the `functions` folder:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   firebase use --add
   ```

#### **3. Configure OpenAI API Key**
1. Create a `.env` file in the `functions` directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
2. Add your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

#### **4. Run Firebase Emulator**
Start the Firebase Emulator for local testing:
```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

#### **5. Open in Xcode**
1. Open the `Wisdom Well` project in Xcode.
2. Run the app on a simulator or connected device.

## **Architecture**

### **Data Flow**
1. **Frontend (SwiftUI)**:
   - Captures user input and sends it as a request to Firebase Functions.
   - Displays responses and error messages dynamically.

2. **Backend (Firebase Functions)**:
   - Validates requests.
   - Uses OpenAI’s API to process the query.
   - Returns the AI-generated response to the app.

3. **External API (OpenAI)**:
   - Processes natural language queries.
   - Generates concise and meaningful biblical insights.

---

## **Development Features**
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for empty queries, invalid API responses, and other issues.
- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Uses `useEmulator` for development and cloud functions in production.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **User Authentication**: Add Firebase Auth to personalize responses and save query history.
- **History Log**: Store past queries and answers using Firestore.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Extend localized responses to more languages.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Allow users to adjust the tone or depth of the answers.
